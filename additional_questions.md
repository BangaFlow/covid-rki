1. **How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?** <br>
   It took me roughly speaking around 10-11 hours. I would like to make it look better on extra large screens.

2. **What alternative approaches/solutions to the user story did you consider when engineering your solution? What benefits/downsides would they have had compared to the selected solution?** <br>
   Intially, I thought about displaying the data in a table element. Then, I was thinking that's dull! as a manager I don't have all day long to start at a table and figure out things on my own. So, I opted to use synched charts to display the data in a more pleasant way. From my perspective, I think charts are easier for the human eyes to process. Therefore, the manager could predict easier his personnel needs according to the displayed data.

3. **What additional features/improvements do you think could help the customer gain more value from your application?** <br>
   I would let the manager to change the period of the data collection according to his own needs rather than showing the data for a fixed period. Maybe the manager wants to check the data for last week only and so on... . I would like also to use a more mature fetching and caching approach like using react-query or SWR.

4. **Where do you see issues in your code that might cause issues in the future? How would you monitor the performance of your app?** <br>
   I would say my tests since they are not optomized and I am a testing newbie myself. I usally do, some network performance simulation(slow connection for example) with chrome dev tools. I would say that I am lacking in this area as well. But, looking forward to step up my testing & monitoring skills in the upcoming months.
5. **How would you improve the API that you just used or its documentation?** <br>
   In my opinion, the API documentation lacks individual endpoints descriptions as to what the developer should be expecting as response from a certain endpoint. In my hubmle opinion, a one liner description is needed.
   For the API it self, maybe making a Graphql API would make it easier for underfetching and overfetching issues.

6. **What did you think about this test? How interesting was it for you? How would you recommend us to improve the test?** <br>
   I think the test is holistic and I had fun building something around a public API. That being said, this made me curious about what could I build next with a public API? The choice of API is really is what made the challenge seems interesting. To be honest, I didn't understand to which level of exprience this test is designed for. Maybe, clearing that point out, in my opionion, would let the candidat feel more comfortable taking the test. Finally, I would say making coding tests with public APIs is a solid choice âœ….
